# QS-Shell apply update.
#
# Topology: the live bar dir is a *copy* of versions/<V>/ from the deploy clone
# at ~/.local/share/quickshell-dots by default (override with QS_SHELL_REPO).
# Updating = pull that repo, redeploy the installed version, restart the bar.
#
# MUST be launched DETACHED from the bar (the QML button uses `setsid`), because
# this script restarts the bar.
#
# Safety contract:
#   - single-flight (flock): no concurrent applies
#   - refuses on a dirty or diverged repo (the repo is the user's workspace)
#   - ALWAYS backs up the live dir first (it may hold un-synced live edits)
#   - atomic same-filesystem rename swap with automatic rollback: $DEST always
#     holds the old OR the new tree in full, and any failure leaves a running bar
#   - persisted settings (slot order / splits) live in ~/.cache and are untouched
